# LM Featured Post

[WordPress Plugin] Mark a post as "Featured Post".

## Description

Created for purposes of demonstration, supported for distribution and free use.

**LM Featured Post** will enable the administrator to mark a post as "Featured Post". It will add a metabox in the post editor so the administrator can mark a post as Featured Post. This plugin is light and coded with best practice.

When a post is set as Featured Post, a ribbon appears at every page of the site with the post's link.

The plugin uses [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) for the data structure, [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards) for enforcing coding conventions and [TimePicki](https://github.com/senthilraj/TimePicki) for the time picker of the expiration date for a Featured Post post.
